# 🎸 Ukulele Tuner (Web App)

This is a small web app that helps you tune your ukulele using your computer's microphone.  
It listens to the sound and shows how close you are to the correct note (A, E, C, G).  
It works entirely in the browser — no downloads needed!

> ✅ Make sure to allow microphone access when your browser asks.  
> 🎧 Works best on Chrome or Firefox.

## 💡 How It Works

- Built with **p5.js** for the canvas and microphone input  
- Uses **ml5.js** (CREPE model) for detecting the pitch of your voice or instrument  
- Visually shows how far off the pitch is — turns green when you're in tune!
